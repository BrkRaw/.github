BrkRaw is a tool that turns raw data from Bruker Biospin preclinical MRI scanners
into standardized, neuroimaging-ready datasets. It enables users to build YAML-based
rules/specs for addons without touching the core codebase, and extends functionality
via Python package entrypoints for plugins. This supports metadata parsing, data
conversion, and reconstruction so raw data can be used easily across downstream
applications with a seamless workflow.

## What we provide

- Tutorials and quick-start guides
- Test datasets
- Specs/rules/mappings for automating standardized data structures (e.g., BIDS)
- Custom reconstruction examples and plugin showcases
- A shared space for community contributions

## Community

We welcome contributors to share rules, specs, plugins, conversion pipelines, and
reconstruction examples built with BrkRaw.

The BrkRaw organization maintains and distributes BrkRaw, which converts raw data
from Bruker Biospin preclinical MRI scanners into standardized, neuroimaging-ready
datasets. At the same time, we enable extension development and distribution without
touching the core codebase through YAML-based rules/specs and Python plugin entrypoints.
Our goal is to make metadata parsing, data conversion, and reconstruction extensible
so the data can be used seamlessly across downstream workflows.

## What we provide

- Tutorials and quick-start guides
- Test datasets
- Specs/rules/mappings for automating standardized data structures (e.g., BIDS)
- Custom reconstruction examples and plugin showcases
- A shared space for community contributions

## Community

We welcome contributors to share rules, specs, plugins, conversion pipelines, and
reconstruction examples built with BrkRaw.
